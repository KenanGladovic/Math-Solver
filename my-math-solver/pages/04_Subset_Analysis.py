**Exam Focus:** Problems involving parameters ($a, t, k$) instead of just numbers.
* **Invertibility:** Find $t$ such that $\det(A) \\neq 0$ (Matrix is invertible).
* **Definiteness:** Find $a$ such that $A$ is Positive Definite (using symbolic reduction).
* **Quadratic Forms:** Convert a polynomial $f(x,y,z)$ into a symmetric matrix $A$.
